## Description
In our increasingly digital world, QR codes have become integral for sharing information conveniently. Inspired by this need, I developed a QR Code Generator project to simplify the process of creating QR codes for various purposes.

The generator is a web-based application built with **JavaScript**, **HTML**, and **CSS**, making it accessible to users across different platforms. It allows users to input the desired information, such as URLs, text, or contact information, and instantly generates a QR code for them to download and share.

The project is hosted on **GitHub Pages**, providing a seamless and user-friendly experience. Users can access the QR Code Generator directly from their browsers, eliminating the need for installations or complex setups.

Whether you're a business owner, event organizer, or just someone who wants to share information efficiently, this QR Code Generator simplifies the process and offers a quick solution.

Feel free to explore the [GitHub repository](https://github.com/Omar-Ebrahim-1/qr-code-generator) for the source code, contribute, or customize it according to your needs.

Happy coding and generating QR codes!
